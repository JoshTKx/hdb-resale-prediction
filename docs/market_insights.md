## Building Age and Depreciation

### Non-Linear Age Relationship
Unlike linear depreciation models, HDB flats show complex age patterns:

**Sweet Spot (5-15 years):**
- Peak pricing period
- Modern amenities with minimal wear
- Established neighborhoods

**Mature Phase (20-30 years):**
- Stable pricing with gradual decline
- Established amenities and transport

**Vintage Premium (30+ years in prime locations):**
- Location value overcomes age factor
- Potential for SERS (redevelopment) premium

### Remaining Lease Impact
**Critical Thresholds:**
- **90+ years**: Full financing available, premium pricing
- **70-89 years**: Standard market pricing
- **60-69 years**: Financing restrictions begin, price discounts
- **<60 years**: Significant discounts, limited financing options

## Storey Height Preferences

### Floor Premium Analysis
**Optimal Floors (7-15):**
- Balance of accessibility and views
- Avoid ground floor issues
- Not too high for comfort

**Ground Floor Challenges:**
- Privacy concerns
- Noise and security issues
- 10-15% price discount typically

**Top Floor Considerations:**
- Heat exposure in tropical climate
- Water pressure issues in older blocks
- Mixed pricing impact (views vs comfort)

## Investment Insights

### High Appreciation Potential
**Criteria for Strong Growth:**
1. **Upcoming MRT Lines**: Transport connectivity boosts
2. **Town Development Plans**: New amenities and infrastructure
3. **School Proximity**: Education hub premiums
4. **SERS Potential**: Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme candidates

### Value Investment Opportunities
**Undervalued Segments:**
- **Transitioning Neighborhoods**: Areas with planned developments
- **Larger Units in Affordable Towns**: Family-sized flats with growth potential
- **Well-Maintained Older Blocks**: Quality construction with location benefits

### Risk Factors
**Depreciation Risks:**
- **Sub-60 Year Leases**: Financing and liquidity challenges

- **Single Transport Mode**: Areas dependent on bus connectivity only

## Policy Implications

### Government Intervention Effectiveness
